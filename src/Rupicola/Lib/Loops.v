  (* Membership proofs are not unique (there could be duplicates in the list),
     and it's a bit off that the spec of foldl allows it to pass the "wrong"
     proof along with a list element.  Switching to a unique equivalent would
     make it clear that the proof's structure is irrelevant (it doesn't
     necessarily encode the element's index), but it requires additional axioms.
     Alternatively, we could track indices and pass them around, and then the
     proof would just be `nth_error` since we'd again be giving the "wrong"
